# crypto-voting
A proof of concept for a voting system.

To run a test for the default system, run main in testComplete.go.
To run a test for longer messages, remove testComplete.go from the configuration and rename the main2 in testLongMessage.go to main before running it.
Only one of testComplete.go or testLongMessage.go needs to be present for either to run. The other files hold the functionality needed to facilitate the tests.
